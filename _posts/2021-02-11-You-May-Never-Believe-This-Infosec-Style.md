You may never believe this, infosec style..

You may never beleive this...Information Security itself isn't hard, doing the work is hard, adulting and working with people is hard.

You may never beleive this...Security practitioners really do care about their companies, customers, clients, peers, the industry, the world.

You may never beleive this...Informaiton Security is a business issue not a technical one.

You may never beleive this...Security exists to support the business and enable competitive advantage.

You may never beleive this...Security practitioners are doing the best we can with what we've got.

You may never beleive this...Security practitioners try really, really hard.

You may never beleive this...Security practitioners are not robots, we cannot work endlessly without exhaustion and burnout.

You may never beleive this...Information Security is still in it's infancy.

You may never beleive this...Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are not the same.

You may never beleive this...Two factor and multifactor authentication, while great, does contribute to user frustration no matter how you slice it.

You may never beleive this...People really do care about security (and privacy), the "trick" is to figure out _why_ they care.

You may never beleive this...We are all in this together.

You may never beleive this...We are all on the same side.
