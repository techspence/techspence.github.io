My happy place. Quebec. With my family. Perfect.


# Happy Places Expand Our Thinking
![quebec.png](/assets/img/quebec.jpg)

I am a big believer in "happy places" and the ability for them to clear our thinking, free up our mental "RAM" in order to expand and grow. Quebec is that place for me.

I love the way the snow cracks under your feet and how your lungs fill fresh air on a really cold morning.

I love the scenery. The endless and beautiful wilderness and mountains.

I love the way I am able to escape the business of daily life.

I love the way I feel when I get back home, realizing how fortunate I am.

But most of all, I love the time spent with my family.

If you have never ventured into Quebec, during the peak of winter, I highly encourage it. If you like snow, and the cold and winter and all that stuff :)
