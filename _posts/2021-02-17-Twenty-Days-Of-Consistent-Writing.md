What happens to your brain when you write every day? The results are pretty interesting, at least for me personally.

*I have written a blog post every day for the last 20 days.

One small caveat is that I did miss a few back to back days in that stretch and I only wrote during the week. The during the week part was intentional. Missing consequetive days was not. :O)

## Why I wanted to write every day
Short answer: I feel like I have something to say.

Long answer: [I write because](https://www.spenceralessi.com/I-Write-Because/)

I wanted to write every day to further develop my understanding of information I ingest and things I learn or read. Such as the [meaning of success](https://www.spenceralessi.com/Sucessful-Leaders-Dont-Win-Copy/), what defines a leader and what winning and losing looks like.

I wanted to write every day to solidify my own beleifs and feelings on subjects such as how I feel about [opportunity](https://www.spenceralessi.com/Abundance/) in the world we live in today or what I think are [important qualities for infosec practitioners](https://www.spenceralessi.com/3-Important-Qualities-For-Infosec-Practitoners/).

I wanted to write every day to provide value, educate, inform, entertain, inspire and/or motivate. That's what I hoped to accomplish with this [infosec thought experiment](https://www.spenceralessi.com/Infosec-What-Are-We-Fighting-For/) and this post about one of my favorite places on earth, [Quebec](https://www.spenceralessi.com/Quebec/). I also hoped to inform or motivate others to use a [password manager](https://www.spenceralessi.com/A-Why-You-Need-To-Use-A-Password-Manager/). Seriously though, use a password manager. :O)

## What I got out of this experiment
This has been a really rewarding experiment for me. 

It has provided me an opportunity to personally grow in new ways. 

It has helped me connect with new people. 

It has helped me become a more avid reader.

I really enjoy sitting down and writing before starting my work day. It is kind of like a mental warm up for the day. It helps me get primed and ready to tackle the more nuanced and challenging parts of my work.

## Thank you
If you have made it this far and have been reading all these posts, firstly, thank you. Second, I would love to know what has kept you sticking around? Hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn and let me know.

Even if you have never read anything I post but you're reading this now, thank you. I hope what I have shared provided you some sort of value or entertainment or inspiration. I hope that I leave you more positive and better than before you got here. :O)

## Where do I go from here?
Well, I don't plan on stopping. I'm going to continue to write every day. This is fun. I enjoy it. I think it makes me a better person and and a better security practitioner. 

See ya tomorrow!
