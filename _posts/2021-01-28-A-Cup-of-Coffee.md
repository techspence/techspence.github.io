_If we were having coffee right now.._

We would not be worrying about staying 6 feet apart.

_If we were having coffee right now.._

We would be talking about how crazy life has been the last couple years.

_If we were having coffee right now.._

We would reminisce about simplier times. When we had no responsibilities.

_If we were having coffee right now.._

We would not be in a global pandemic.

_If we were having coffee right now.._

Life would be back to normal.

Normal sounds really good right about now.
