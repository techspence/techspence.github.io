When I was younger I thought I knew everything. How naive right? In a way though...I did know everything.

See the problem was, what I didn't know at that time was that I don't know what I don't know. That's what makes this tweet by [E. J. Koh](https://twitter.com/thisisEJKoh) resonate with me so much.

I have learned, just like this tweet says, that education and learning and growing and leveling up are lifelong pursuits. There is no end game. This is very much so an [infinite game](https://www.spenceralessi.com/Abundance/), as Simon Sinek would describe it.

Ever play the game You Don't Know Jack? Do you remember it from "back in the day?" :) Well, try as you might and much like every other trivia game there is undoubtably things you just don't know. You can answer 100 questions in a row and the next one you could not know. That's what I think of when I read this tweet.

This is something I am desparately trying to impart to my kids. The love and enthusiasm to be a lifelong learner. To be obsessed with [knowing more today than they did yesterday](https://www.spenceralessi.com/Progress-Is-Made-By-Doing-Not-By-Pondering/). One of my jobs as a parent is to foster this love for learning, a love to be [curious](https://www.spenceralessi.com/3-Important-Qualities-For-Infosec-Practitoners/).

So, I could not agree with this tweet more. I love this. 

What about you?
