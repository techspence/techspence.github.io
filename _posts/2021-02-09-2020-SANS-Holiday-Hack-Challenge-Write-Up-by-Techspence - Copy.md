My report is not as polished as I would like but every year I think I improve upon it. If anyone has any feedback or has any comments about the approach I took to solve the challenges and objectives I would love to hear it. Hit me up on Twitter at [@techspence](https://twitter.com/techspence). If you would like to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spenceralessi/), look me up!

Here's a link to open my write-up in PDF. Enjoy!
