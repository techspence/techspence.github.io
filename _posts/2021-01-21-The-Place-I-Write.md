Every morning for the last 6 days, usually for 10-15 minutes between 8-9am, I write.

There are several reasons [why I write](https://www.spenceralessi.com/I-Write-Because/) all of which improve as I get better at articulating the thoughts in my head. That's why I started a writing prompt program. Something that can give me ideas and help to keep me accountable.

Part of that accountability for me is having my "own space." Having a space that when I enter I am able to shift my focus and my mindset to "work mode." Fortunately, I have a home office and I have been working from home since the beginning of 2020.

The house I live in used to be my Grandfather's and he would always call this space the "den." Prior to my residence here there was a nice red leather chair and an old couch with deep red curtains. The walls are wood paneled. 

The wood is quite dark though so with the curtains closed you definitely need a light source. Having dabbled in photography naturally I hooked up some video lights and bounce the light off the white ceiling. Combined with an old lamp provides a nice calm light.

I have tried to spruce up the room a bit with wall art. One peice is an amazing photo by [Bare](https://instagram.com/wallabarephotos). Really amazing photos, go check them out. Another wall decoration is a canvas my wife and kids made. It has a sweet poem and handprints of my kids. 

My desk is the centerpeice of the room. It's made of solid oak and weighs what I can only imagine is like 400 pounds. I have had this desk since I was a kid. It was the desk I would play video games at until all hours of the night when I lived at home.

I hope you have enjoyed this bit of rambling about the place I write.
