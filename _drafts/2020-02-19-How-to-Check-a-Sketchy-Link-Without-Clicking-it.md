# Whats a sketchy link?

When it comes to hyperlinks, sometime's it's really obvious the link is sketchy, but other times, in the case of look-a-like domains, it can actually be a bit tricky. 

Here are a few things that make a link sketchy, when visibly looking it. These are often referred to as `red flags`.

- Links that end in uncommon top level domains (TLD)
    - Examples
        - .xyz
        - .buzz
        - .live
        - .fit
        - .tk

- Links that are knock-offs of major brands
    - Examples
        - netflix-mail[.]com
        - t-mogbile[.]com
        - googlre[.]com

- Links that contain random series of numbers and/or letters
    - Example
        - eqbqcguiwcymao[.]info
