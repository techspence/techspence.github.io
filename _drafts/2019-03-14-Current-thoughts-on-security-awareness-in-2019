# Step 1. Communication
The most important step. Communication is the bedrock of a successful security program. Whether you're the CISO, analyst or just in charge of the security awareness program, it's your duty to inform and communicate with your co-workers the importance of practicing safe email habits. 

I've personally had conversations with co-workers who felt like they were a bother to IT so they didn't speak up when they had an issue with their computer. This is the opposite of the environment you want to create. When this happened to me, I reassured this person that, regardless of our protocol, if there's an issue, let someone in IT know and we will get someone on it right away.

I would never have known about this issue nor would I have been able to address it and reassure this co-worker if the lines of communication were not open. If this person didn't feel like they could talk to me, because they felt like they were a "bother" I could not have solved this problem.

Communication is not only important, its critical. I guarantee you, even if you think you're a good communicator, you can do better and communicate more.

Step 2. Technology

Step 3. Education
Educate the CEO on current and emerging email threats. This is not a static exercise. This is something you should do continuously.
