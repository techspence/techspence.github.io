**What is this?**

A mega huge list of FREE Offensive cybersecurity training courses and educational content.


**Why did I create this?**

There's an abundance of great free content related to Penetration testing and I wanted to create one consolidated location for myself, and share it with the community.

Not everyone can spend money on full-fledge SANS training or university courses or even udemy/etc courses. There's so much quality content that is free.


Google is your best friend, use it, a lot!
