# How to Talk to your CEO about Phishing

Now you might be asking yeah but what does this have to do with my CEO? My point here is that you want to strive for open and honest communication with your CEO. The more open the line of communication is, the better. A few minutes ot check out an email is far better than a few million dollars lost due to a phishing email. 

One way to break the ice and begin the conversation is to just ask your CEO if he/she has seen any weird or suspicious emails lately. Then take it from there based on their response. Depending on time allowed, and what level of tech savvy your CEO is, share one tip, your CEO can use to immediately improve their chances of detecting phishing emails. Such as hovering your mouse over hyperlinks in emails or viewing the email headers to inspect the sender address.

Communication is a journey and a process, not a destination.

Although it's fairly conventional for companies to have an email gateway, the surging popularity of cloud email platforms such as Office 365 and Gmail have caused companies to outsource their email gateways. This is a double edge sword. Less to manage, but also less control.

If, however, your company does maintain and control your own email gateway or email filtering platform, then this section is for you. I want to share with you a couple email filtering rules that I think greatly help protect your CEO and your company from phishing and CEO fraud emails.


# Step 1. Communication
The most important step. Communication is the bedrock of a successful security program. Whether you're the CISO, analyst or just in charge of the security awareness program, it's your duty to inform and communicate with your co-workers the importance of practicing safe email habits. 

I've personally had conversations with co-workers who felt like they were a bother to IT so they didn't speak up when they had an issue with their computer. This is the opposite of the environment you want to create. When this happened to me, I reassured this person that, regardless of our protocol, if there's an issue, let someone in IT know and we will get someone on it right away.

I would never have known about this issue nor would I have been able to address it and reassure this co-worker if the lines of communication were not open. If this person didn't feel like they could talk to me, because they felt like they were a "bother" I could not have solved this problem.

Communication is not only important, its critical. I guarantee you, even if you think you're a good communicator, you can do better and communicate more.


# Step 2. Technology


# Step 3. Education
Educate the CEO on current and emerging email threats. This is not a static exercise. This is something you should do continuously.
