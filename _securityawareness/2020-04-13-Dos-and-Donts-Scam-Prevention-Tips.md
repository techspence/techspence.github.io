My bank recently sent me an email about the DOs and DON'TS of protecting yourself against scams. While they had some great tips, I felt like some of them fell short. So I wanted to share some of my own scam prevention tips in hopes that they provide you some things to consider. So here are 6 DOs and 6 DON'Ts when it comes to scam prevention.

# The Dos and Don'ts of Protecting Yourself from Falling Victim to Scams
